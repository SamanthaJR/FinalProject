    <string name="explanation">SecureLock is a new application for extra secure online logins. No more messing around with card readers, SecureLock allows you to confirm your identity with just the click of a button. It\'s simple: register your device once, create a username and password, and then login online. Every time you attempt a login, the SecureLock app will send you a prompt, asking you to allow or decline the login attempt. All you have to do is click a button to allow yourself in or stop a fraudster. It couldn\'t be easier.</string>
    <string name="location_explanation">And what if you don\'t have your phone on you when you really need access? SecureLock allows you to login without your device with the use of its unique Safe Locations feature. Just specify certain areas, such as your work place or home, that you consider safe and give them a name. When you try to login without your device, just tell SecureLock where your phone is by giving the location name and if your phone is where you say it is, the login will proceed as normal.</string>
